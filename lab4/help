int packets()
Print the packets received from the mouse
Terminate after processing the given number of packets
Display the packets contents in a human friendly way (see
Figure 1 of lab handout)
Need to subscribe the mouse interrupts
Upon an interrupt, read the byte from the OUT_BUF
Subscribe the mouse interrupt with
IRQ_EXCLUSIVE policy
driver_receive() loop
Should read only one byte per interrupt
Should use:
unsigned char packet[] to store the packet bytes
unsgined short counter to keep track of byte number
Synchronization Issues All 3 bytes must belong to the same packet
Bit 3 of first byte of a packet is always set
But this bit may also be set in other bytes of a packet
Hints : No need to check the STAT_REG
If the device is in Stream mode (the default) and has been enabled
with an Enable (0xF4) command, then the host should disable the
device with a Disable (0xF5) command before sending any other command.
If a byte is left in the OUT_BUF ,the KBC will not generate further interrupts
